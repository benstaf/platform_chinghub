We are happy to announce our partnership with Petrovax Pharma LLC, who are submitting a drug repurposing project about azoximer bromide (Commercial name: [PolyoxidoniumÂ®](http://petrovax.com/medication/catalog/polyoxydonium/)). 

Petrovax already have an observational series of Covid-19 patients treated with azoximer bromide in Moscow hospitals, and they are now looking urgently for a virtual control arm treated with "standard-of-care" (with Covid-19, that's a tough definition!).

To get involved, we are waiting for your data as soon as possible. 
More generally, your participation will accelerate our data standardization process.

A data sample has already been released by Dr Imran and Iqbal, from Shaikh Zayed hospital in Lahore, Pakistan. Special thanks for their reactivity and speed!

We remain open for more projects and ideas around Covid-19 individual patient data. This exciting field is moving fast!
